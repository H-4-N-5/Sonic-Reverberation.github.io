              <p>
              With a progression of technology comes an adapted way of life. The relationships we develop no longer abide by the same rules. The way we meet people and maintain relationships has been adjusted to the digital culture we now live in. 
              <br/>
              <p>
              Dr. Gary Chapman, long-time relationship counselor and author of The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts believes that there are “five ways that people speak and understand emotional love.” (Chapman 15) The “five emotional love languages” include: words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch (15). Chapman claims “love plays a central role in life,” and “the need to feel loved is a primary human emotional need;” therefore, we must learn how to express our love to others in a way they will understand—we need to speak their love language (19). On the flip side of this, you need others to speak your love language in order for you to feel loved.
              <br/>
              <p>
              Learning what your primary love language is, and learning how to speak your partner’s, will foster “a long-lasting, loving” relationship (16). Love is a choice, and choosing whether or not you’re going to make the effort is up to the individual. That is, we can choose whether or not to express our love. 
              <br/>
              <p>
              In the Digital Age there are more channels to express love than ever before. Technology has taken charge of the way we shape relationships. Whether it’s through Facebook, Instagram, Tinder, OKcupid, or Match.com, online interaction has become a main form of communication in our society, and because of this shift, we as a society need to alter the way we seek out partners.
              <br/>
              <p>
              Paragraph...word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word 
              <br/>
              <p>
              When interviewing college aged students about dating and finding love, several of them admitted to having Tinder or OKCupid accounts. For those who are not familiar, these are both location-based dating and social discovery applications that facilitate communication between mutually interested users, allowing matched users to chat and potentially form a relationship. While interviewing one couple about meeting online, they pointed out that online dating is refreshing because most sites include a bio about the person, which “gets everything out in the open.” 
              <br/>
              <p>
              The boyfriend talked lovingly about his girlfriend and said that he liked meeting her online because he felt as though they were able to “skip all the ‘BS’ of the first couple of dates.” He also discussed the effortlessness of it all, and how, because their relationship started online, it was much easier to feel in touch all the time. He went on to point out how important it was to the relationship, and how it made him feel connected to her even when she wasn’t around. Communication is an important element in maintaining any relationship, and for them technology and online resources really helped to uphold this principle.
              <br/>
              <p>
              Another question on the survey addressed the question of what people thought was the most important aspect of maintaining a relationship. Almost everyone answered that communication was key. Given these answers, and the change in our culture, it’s interesting to find out that in such a seemingly distant digital age, people still feel that communication is a present, and necessary, aspect to maintaining healthy relationships. 
              <br/>
              <p>
              In fact when interviewing several couples of all ages, we found that most of them used technology to maintain their relationships, i.e. texting, Facebook comments/likes, etc. An older woman, who is age 58 and has been married to her husband of fifteen years, shared with us that the reason her relationship has lasted so long is due to “proper communication.” When asking her to further explain her statement, she said that in person interaction is very important, especially since her husband travels for work. She said, “Being able to see all of his pictures on Facebook, and skyping when he’s away really helps [it] feel like I’m there with him. It closes the gap.”
              <br/>
              <p>
              Given these answers, we found that people agree that communication is a main tool in keeping a healthy relationship. We also found that these people, whether meeting in person or online, use social media as a main form of communication. Given the results of our research, technology seems to play a significant role in our cultural norms, which includes dating. So, can it be concluded that technology and social media have become inevitable components of our “love languages” in order to maintain a long lasting healthy relationship? 
              <br/>
              <p>
              Now that we live in the Digital Age, how do we express these love languages? If words of affirmation are “powerful communicators of love” and can be spoken through “verbal compliments, or words of appreciation,” do Facebook and Instagram likes constitute another type of verbal affirmation (37)? What about comments on social media? Posting comments on social media makes this love language more public in today’s day-in-age. If our comments and compliments are made public, do we hold ourselves back? Or do we say things we don’t truly mean but say for our “image”? being in public can lead people to be insincere in their words and actions. Just because we now have more channels to speak this love language through, it does not mean that our words will be as sincere as they may be behind closed doors.
              <br/>
              <p>
                Well what about the convenient, yet private, form of texting? Does texting make it easier than ever to send your loved one a few words of affirmation throughout the day? It’s a relatively new phenomenon, and it can be handy; however, we have to be careful because texting can send mixed messages to others. For couples, “sometimes our words say one thing, but our tone of voice says another,” and over text it’s hard to tell what someone’s tone is (43). Without knowing the tone in which the words are meant to be spoken, the text message’s meaning can get lost in translation. Luckily, emojis have made the messages we’re sending and receiving clearer. Since we can’t see each other’s faces while texting, the emojis help to express our emotions we’re feeling.
                <br/>
               <p>
                 In the 21st century, quality time can be a hard language to express. Since this is the generation all about “me”, giving up one’s personal time for another can be a lot to ask. In Eve Fairbank’s article, Love in the Age of Big Data, she mentions “the power of ‘we’”. Our world has become so much about independence and career-success that we have lost the sense of togetherness. For couples, it is often hard to give up one’s time working in the office, making money, to spend quality time with his or her partner. Time has, and always will be, “a precious commodity.” (Chapman 55) even when couples do spend time together, out of the office, it can be challenging “in this era of many distractions” to give your partner quality time with undivided, “focused attention,” (59). You can’t multitask when trying to truly speak your partner’s love language.
                <br/>
               <p>
                 What if technology begins speaking your partner’s love language for you? With sites such as Amazon, giving gifts has never been easier. A gift can be given with a click of a mouse, and anything anyone could ever purchase, can be given to their significant other because of all the Internet sites that sell products, goods and services. Does this make the love language of gift giving less powerful since it is so easily done? What about the fact that sites give you recommendations on what you may want to purchase based off of previous purchases? Your computer may be the one giving you the idea for what gift to give, rather than you thinking of it yourself. Does this undermine the quality of the gift? Isn’t the whole “thoughtfulness” of a gift based on the notion that you have put time, effort and consideration into what you want to purchase for your loved one? So, if the Internet’s cookies decide what your partner will like, you’re no longer the one with the “thoughtful” idea.
